      content:
        "When ‘Global’ is applied onto a section, the content within that specific section will be the same across your entire website. For example, if the ‘About’ template and ‘Blog’ template are both using an email signup section that is indicated as ‘Global’, the section will appear the same on both pages. When customizing a global section in the Shopify editor, changes will be reflected on all the pages that have it. Therefore, you will not need to go into every page to update the section. On the other hand, Unique sections will only reflect their customizations on their specific page.",
